# CSV to JSON Converter

A node script that converts CSV (Comma-Separated-Value) files into JSON format.
The 1st row of the CSV file acts as the keys/properties of the JSON object and the rest of the fields act as values.

### Notes

This is a functional script but it was written mostly to practice JavaScript. The exercise idea was taken from edX's [Introduction to Nodejs Course](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:Microsoft+DEV283x+3T2018/course/). 
Here's a [link](https://courses.edx.org/assets/courseware/v1/e4a71acedf9aa49aae4b59c95a888207/asset-v1:Microsoft+DEV283x+3T2018+type@asset+block/m1-index-solution.js) to the solution script from the course.

### Installation

This script requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) to run.

Install the dependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd csv-to-json-converter
$ npm install
$ node csv-to-json.js
```
